    <h2><sup>What is this avatar?</sup></h2>
    <p> 
        This image is my avatar from the animated series known as "One Piece." His name is Tony Tony Chopper, and he is a blue-nosed reindeer. In the series, he is a crew member for a pirate group and serves as a ship doctor.
        Chopper was originally a regular reindeer with a birth defect of having a blue nose. Because he had a blue nose, he was an outcast towards other reindeer.
        Chopper has special abilities that allow him to transform due to him eating a devil fruit, which also allows him to communicate with humans.
        He set out to become a doctor for his island after being inspired by another doctor that wished to cure the world.
    </p>

    <h2><sup>How did Chopper become a pirate?</sup></h2>
    <p>
        Chopper became a pirate after meeting the Strawhat pirates. The Strawhats did not have a ship doctor and were looking for a doctor to cure their friend that had a virus.
        They stumbled upon the island where Chopper lived, and the Strawhat pirates and Chopper got along very well. Chopper cured their friend from the virus, the Strawhat pirates' captain known as Luffy wanted 
        Chopper to join their crew as their ship doctor. Chopper has always wanted to sail the seas and travel the world to fulfill his dream of curing 
        the world from sicknesses, so Chopper then joined the Strawhats.
    </p>

    <h2><sup>Why was this my choice of avatar?</sup></h2>
    <p>
        I chose this avatar because Chopper is one of my favorite characters from the series. Chopper has a very good story of his upbringing and 
        has ambitious goals for the world in One Piece. Chopper's character design also seemed like a good choice to have as an
        avatar; it's simple and a good display, in my opinion. Another reason why I chose Chopper as an avatar is because One Piece is also one of my favorite series. <em>"The One Piece is real!"</em>
    </p>

    <h2><sup>More about Chopper:</sup></h2>
    <p>
        Chopper is an honest and genuine character in One Piece. He takes many things literally, especially since he's a reindeer. He most often doesn't understand many jokes that humans can have, which makes him funny. Chopper is very intelligent as a doctor and is ranked as one of
        the best in the world of One Piece. He was trained by another doctor named Doctorine, a woman that is 139 years old. Chopper has multiple transformations that allow
        him to take many shapes and forms. Some of his transformations allow him to be defensive or aggressive towards enemies that try to attack him and his crew. Chopper likes getting 
        compliments but he tries his hardest to seem mad after getting compliments but fails to display that and ends up looking funny.
        Currently, Chopper has a wanted bounty with a value of 1,000 berries. It is extremely low because the world government of One Piece believes that he's just a pet for the Strawhat Pirates.
